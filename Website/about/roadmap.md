!!! warning "Some opportunities and IRL obligations are being focused on"

I have a pretty decent vision for any **two next weeks** of development, and work based on **priorities** that would give the **most value** and **quality of life** to the Projects.

- Items may happen out of order, delayed, not at all, and retroactively apply
- Minor unlisted items may be worked on instead of listed ones

<hr>

## **Stage 1:** Low Hanging Fruits
!!! success "**Quality of Life** features for what works today"
- [x] ~~Fastest Piano Roll code in Python in the world~~
- [x] Code logistics for FFmpeg advanced and easy configuration
- [x] Write CI workflows for releases, PyPI and GitHub Pages
- [ ] Improve the Website and Documentation
- [ ] Preset System for DepthFlow, CLI and API friendly
- [ ] Better ShaderFlow Shader Library include file
- [ ] Improve User Experience on Pianola
- [ ] Make DepthFlow's logic extensible and usable on ShaderFlow

**Eta**: Q3 2024

<hr>

## **Stage 2:** More Features
!!! example "**Get it Working**, move fast and break things"
- [ ] Internal rewrite and implementation of Imgui helpers for ShaderFlow
- [ ] (Re)writing all function docstrings for the Code Reference
- [ ] Rework ShaderFlow Shaders metaprogramming system
- [ ] Real Time playing on Pianola with MIDI Keyboards
- [ ] More "fully featured" Scenes than tech demos
- [ ] More Scientific Audio DSP of value magnitudes
- [ ] Configurable Hotkeys for ShaderFlow

**Eta**: Q4 2024

## **Stage 3:** Get it Right

- [ ] General code stability improvements
- [x] Split projects into their own packages[^1]
- [ ] Write Test units for the code
- [ ] Simplify stuff, automate code

**Eta**: Q1 2025++

## **Eventually:** Out of my Scope
!!! quote "What the future holds"
- [ ] Logos for the projects

**Eta**: 202X
