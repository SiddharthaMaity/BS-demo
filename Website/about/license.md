You must always check the Repository's `License.md` file for **legal information**, or the contents of any **Source Code file** for copyright information and use

- **This page's** contents are {--_a custom licensing model_--} {++‚úÖ fair encouragements++}

- **For my integrity**[^integrity], I may change this page at any time

## Use cases

There are a few **end goals** on which the Projects can be used:

<hr>

### üî¥ Personal use
There are **no restrictions** on **private** use of any Software {>>(family, friends, you)<<}

- Be creative and have fun. Study and modify as you like
- No strings attached! It's [**Free and Open Source Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="_blank"}
- {>>(And link the Project if they're interested :)<<}

!!! note "**Note:** Monetizing online content counts as Commercial Use"

<hr>


### üü° Educational use
**I am more than happy** if you're using anything for {>>institutional<<} purposes

- You _should not paywall_ this content, science must be free
- Feel absolutely free to automate, deploy for students
- I deeply hope it helps your community to learn :)

??? note "**Note:** Using Copyrighted Material you do not own might fall under Educational Use"
    Using **Copyrighted Work** as input assets is a great way to check the final quality of anything

    **As you don't own the material's copyright, you can't sell it**. Nevertheless, you're _probably_ fine sharing it online, specially if it's for a small amount of people or.. allegedly _for educational purposes_

    - Beware the material owners might takedown your work at any time


<hr>


### üü¢ Commercial use
<div class="annotate" markdown>
**Here's the dilema:** {==If I was against commercial use, I wouldn't use it myself as a user==} (1)
</div>
1.   Not only that, I depend on many [**Shoulders of Giants**](site:about/credit)
<div/>

- **My mission is to empower you**, and make awesome tools to the world
- I must be doing well to continue the work, _we live in a society..._
- It is **my desire and goal** for you to use the tools commercially

!!! heart annotate "**Fairness makes the difference**"
    **If you're profiting** from my work, [**donate**](site:about/sponsors){:target="_blank"} an amount that **reflects** how much **essential** it was to your success

    - The bigger you are, the more you can feed my gratitude of empowering you üò≠
    - **Remember**: I provide professional, high quality tools for free (1)

1.  You have **locally run, free alternatives** for:
    - Services like [**LeiaPix**](https://www.immersity.ai/){:target="_blank"}: $0.50 per video
    - Services like [**Specterr**](https://specterr.com/pricing/){:target="_blank"}: $75.00 per month
    - [**Synthesia**](https://synthesiagame.com/){:target="_blank"}: One time $40.00 payment

??? note "**Click for {>>(self judged)<<} fair examples**"
    ‚úÖ Warm feeling of giving something back:

    - **A [Shader you coded](site:shaderflow){:target="_blank"} for your video:** _Single time 10-20 bucks_ {>>(ShaderFlow convenience framework)<<}
    - **[DepthFlow](site:depthflow){:target="_blank"} inserts in your content:** _Maybe $0.25 per insert?_ {>>(The Product is better than competition)<<}
    - **[Piano visualizations](site:pianola){:target="_blank"} you posted:** _Single time 5 or 10 bucks_ {>>(Spring physics are worth it !)<<}

    ‚úÖ Infinite revenue:

    - **Your music channel under [ShaderFlow](site:shaderflow){:target="_blank"}:** _Perhaps $50+ monthly_ {>>(Depends on size and engagement)<<}
    - **Automated accounts farming videos:** _Perhaps 20% of total_ {>>(We're dead internet entrepreneurs, lol?)<<}
    - **Live streaming procedural content:** _Perhaps 5% of total_ {>>(Make yours stream catchier OwO)9<<}
