Large batch of features of the v0.4.0 release

<!-- more -->

## Technical changes

The changes below aren't exhaustive, I'll keep track more closely on future releases

**Broken**:

- Fix: Always `.upper()` values from `LOGLEVEL`
- Add `valid: bool` on `BrokenPath` initialization itself, as `BrokenPath(None).valid()` is invalid
- Fix: `BrokenTyper` replace '_' with '-' on given command names and `tuple(map(str, args))` them
- Fixed BrokenAudioReader not yielding data if `chunk=0` when entering the context
- Rewrite FFmpeg file, options for easily exporting to H264, HEVC, AV1, VP9, (+NVENC alts)
- Rewrite Upscalers file, much more stable and better code
- Reimplement threaded stdin writing directly on `shell` command
- Performance improvement on BrokenScheduler by reducing sanitization overhead (roughly 6%)

**ShaderFlow**:

- Prompt the user to install audio server packages if `soundcard` import fails
- Always use EGL for creating the OpenGL context, disableable with `WINDOW_EGL=0`
- Safety checks for all modules to be initialized with `Module(self=instance(ShaderScene))`
    - Don't worry, a scene itself defaults `self.scene = self` so it is a scene !
    - This enables type hinting on the Module class, that depends on Scene, which depends on Module
- Always swap buffers even if on headless, NVIDIA driver was softlocking/hanging on benchmark mode
- Added `ShaderScene.cycle` variable. `tau` is normalized time, and `cycle` is norm angle `2pi*tau`
- Renamed `Message` to `ShaderMessage` for consistency (psa. Shader is short for ShaderFlow)
- Rename `ShaderScene.main(end)` to `ShaderScene.main(time)`
- The default quality level is now `50%`, for equal options on increasing or decreasing
- Rewrite Monocular Depth Estimators class, options for DepthAnything(1,2), ZoeDepth, Marigold
- Depth estimators now use and saves uint16 pngs file for better precision on large offsets
- The equirectangular 360Â° videos projection mode can now be 'zoomed' with regular zoom factor
- Added .on_frame BrokenRelay to ShaderVideo, for user option to process raw video frames
- Video flipping is now applied on the shader side when rendering, instead of ffmpeg -vf vflip
- Added a `ShaderCamera.rotate2d()` method for static and known angles relative to the screen plane
- Fix first frametime of the scheduler either being too short or long; now a perfect 1/fps start
- Improved music visualizer demo scene

**DepthFlow**:

- Huge performance gains on the shader by walking on bigger steps first, then precise backwards
- Big performance gain on not calculating `tan(theta)` on every loop (that was uneventful lol)
- Per uint16 depth maps, removed the option to upscale them, as ncnn doesn't implement it
- Added a `vec2 iDepthCenter` shader variable for true camera offsets
- Renamed `focus->static` and `plane->focus` for better clarity
- Renamed all shader variables prefixes from `iParallax` to `iDepth`
