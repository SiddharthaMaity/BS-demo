> A bag of new featurs that will stabilize in the upcoming patch versions

<!-- more -->

**General**:

- The new minimum Python version is 3.9
- Added `Broken.temp_env` context, might be useful later
- Added `OnceTracker`, complementing `SameTracker` values
- Fix `StopIteration` on `BrokenPath.*.extract().rglob()` due bad Path with double output stems

**ShaderFlow**:

- **Bugfixes**:
    - Reset time when pressing "o" for resetting the Scene
    - Set `repeat=False` on shader texture, as it was wrapping pixels on `ssaa<1`
    - Progress bar no longer interfered with window visibility `log.info` (changed to `log.debug`)
    - Improve precision of finding a (numerator, denominator) on glfw.set_window_aspect_ratio
    - Integration on values close to target in Dynamics should not be skipped
    - Use multiple threads in PyTorch due NumPy import with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`

- **Additions/Changes**:
    - Initial logic for batch exporting:
        - Add `hyphen_range` parser to the shared library for that
        - New `--batch/-b` command on ShaderScene's main
    - The `scale` is now an attribute, rather than carrying pre-multiplication on width and height
    - Performance improvement on not importing full `arrow` on `ShaderScene.main`
    - Renamed `SHADERFLOW_BACKEND` to `WINDOW_BACKEND` env configuration
    - Add `.instant = True` mode on DynamicNumber, should be useful later on
    - Always build scenes when initializing, so it's not explicit or not assumes else;
        - Fixme: When one just wants the CLI, the full window and shader shall be loaded
    - Add `.duration` property to ShaderPiano, rename some attributes
    - Fix and rename the Motion Blur scene. Instead of bindless textures, return `vec4` switch case
    - The camera 2D Projection plane is now generic, slightly more costly but worth it
        - The plane is defined by `camera.plane_point` and `camera.plane_normal` on manual inits

**DepthFlow**:

- **Additions/Changes**:
    - Refactor `parallax_*` attributes to a state dictionary
    - Implement a new static-projections focal depth plane attribute

**Pianola**:

- Improved visuals, note border and beat markers
- Set initial time to minus roll time, so notes don't suddenly appear
- Set the Scene runtime to the Midi's one when loading
- Unify Midi loading on a `.load_midi` function
