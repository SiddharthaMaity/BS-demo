<!-- more -->

**General**:

- Iterate over `site.getsitepackages()` for finding PyTorch version instead of `[-1]`

**ShaderFlow**:

- Fix early Shader rendering when they weren't compiled on Windows
    - Caused by the hidden GLFW window signaling a resize when final resolution was set calculated
- Temporary Debug UI modules contents are expanded by default
- Add an opt-out `WINDOW_EGL=1` env var for Linux Headless rendering

**DepthFlow**:

- Add Depth of Field and Vignette post processing effects.
    - Disabled by default until better parameters are found, and maybe a faster blur
