**General**:

- Fixed PyApp releases of the projects in the new single wheel architecture
    - The venv is shared across same-version projects and managed by uv
    - **Fixme hack:** PyTorch flavor is being passed as `PYAPP_SELF_COMMAND` until we can send envs
- Projects requiring PyTorch now have a prompt to install it if not found
- Windows NTFS workaround on deleting the release venv if a reinstall is due
- Use newest version of PyApp, as yanked dependency specification was updated

**DepthFlow**:

- Use `SSAA=1.5` by default, for sharper images than brute forcing `quality` parameter
