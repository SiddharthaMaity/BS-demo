**ShaderFlow**:

- Fixes for True Headless rendering with `SHADERFLOW_BACKEND=headless` on Linux servers by using [**EGL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API)) backend on [**glcontext**](https://github.com/moderngl/glcontext) of the ModernGL Window, so `xvfb-run`/X11 is no longer needed, and GPU acceleration should work

- **Mechanism** to **enforce Aspect Ratio** on Scenes:
    - Without AR, keep previous resolution and override `-w` or `-h`
    - With AR, when one component is sent, calculate the other,-
    - If both are sent, calculates height based on width (prioritizes)
    - Option to limit to a maximum resolution (often the Monitor size)
    - Rounds to nearest multiple of two, so FFmpeg is happy

- **Performance improvements**:
    - The final Fractional SSAA Shader doesn't need the full pipeline
    - Pre-allocate a Buffer to copy each rendered frame to when exporting, to avoid the creation of a temporary `bytes` object
    - _Mystery_: Threaded pipes to FFmpeg subprocess on Linux are wayy faster than single threaded, even though they perform a COPY on each new frame and the subprocess stdin is a `BufferedIO`. Windows performance is comparable to Linux with synchronous code, as expected

**DepthFlow**:

- Now applies the new AR enforcing on loaded images resolution
- All of ShaderFlow above applies

**Known Issues**:

- AttributeError on BrokenPath in Python 3.12

**Fixes**:

- Added [**`cmake`**](https://github.com/tuxu/python-samplerate/tree/fix_cmake_dep) to `[build-system.requires]` for `samplerate`
